#Introduction
So you want to learn how to develop 3D experiences for games and virtual reality, but have no idea where to start? <!-- TODO: Write a better introduction --> This is the place to do it!

This Unity tutorial is designed to help you take your previous experience writing for mobile, desktop, or the web and learn how to turn that knowledge into building a 3D application from start to finish. Our hope is to bring together the best resources to give you the tools to create richly immersive experiences.

Unity can seem imposing when you first start out, because if you don't have prior experience working with 3-Dimensional objects or writing games, the IDE will seem kind of alien. That said, it's easy to start making immediate progress right away after you figure out the basics of creating different game components.

There are a lot of ways to create 3D environments - this is a simple tutorial to get you started with developing for VR without spending money on rendering software or expensive assets: everything in this tutorial is done without a need to spend money on components, though you can upgrade your own experiences as desired as you go through.

Disclaimer: I use the term 'game' here to describe any type of interactive 3D experience until I can find a better word for it. <!-- TODO: make up word? -->  

<!--TODO: Finish this with something nice -->

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of C# is helpful, but not required
<!-- TODO: Could do a potential version using UnityScript (JS) as well -->
