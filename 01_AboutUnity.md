##About Unity, Mono Develop, and 3D Development

Up until recently, consumable web content has been almost entirely relegated to a two-dimensional experience with the exception of one field: the gaming industry. The majority of information about Unity is geared towards game developers, and while this tutorial will walk through the basics of gameplay, it will be interspersed with more general information about non-gaming applications for Unity's toolset, generally around VR.

## Unity and Mono Develop

Unity is arguably one of the most common platform that developers use to create 3D & virtual applications. <a href = "http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/10/27/unity-5-0-pre-order-beta-now-available/"> Although Unity 5.0 is currently in beta </a>, we will be using the 4.5.5 version for this tutorial. Unity is basically a special-effects-in-a-box development IDE, and it is both extensible and customizable.

The actual coding that you'll do in your Unity applications will, by default, be done in Mono Develop, a lightweight code editor that comes as part of the package. For simplicity, I'll be doing the tutorial using Mono & Unity, but you can find plenty of resources for how to change the text editor.

## Developing for 3D
There is a growing need for developers familiar with Unity as the virtual reality industry takes off. Developing 3D environments requires a focus on interactions, physics, and the ability to translate real world experiences into code, especially when focusing on building for VR.
