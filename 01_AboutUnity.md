##About Unity, Mono Develop, and 3D Development

Up until recently, consumable content has been almost entirely relegated to a two-dimensional experience with the exception of one field: the gaming industry. The majority of information about Unity is geared towards game developers, and while this tutorial will walk through the basics of gameplay, it will be interspersed with more general information about non-gaming applications for Unity's toolset, generally around VR.

This tutorial is for you if you have an interest in developing games or virtual reality applications but don't know where to start - we'll walk through the process of setting up the Unity developer environment, create a simple environment with basic texture applications, lighting, and particle effects, and add in a game play component that times our progress through the maze and lets us reset to the beginning. Finally, we'll look at the Oculus SDK and enable VR support for the Oculus Rift.

## Unity and Mono Develop

Unity is arguably one of the most common platforms that developers use to create 3D & virtual applications. We will be using the 5.0.0 version for this tutorial. Unity is basically a special-effects-in-a-box development IDE, and it is both extensible and customizable through add-ons and asset plugins.

The actual coding that you'll do in your Unity applications will, by default, be done in Mono Develop, a lightweight code editor that comes as part of the package. For simplicity, I'll be doing the tutorial using Mono & Unity, but you can find plenty of resources for how to change the text editor.

## Developing for 3D
There is a growing need for developers to become familiar with Unity and other 3D development tools as the virtual reality industry takes off. Developing 3D environments requires a focus on interactions, physics, and the ability to translate real world experiences into code, especially when focusing on building for VR. Scale and perception become a larger requirement for successful applications, and universes are completely immersive, and content exists in a sphere around the camera perspective rather than only on a single page or window in front of the viewer.
