Now that we've got a nice environment set up, it's time to add a few components that make our game more enjoyable. We're going to include a basic GUI control so that you can see your time throughout the maze, a gameplay mechanism for winning, and a few other components to make the experience more challenging.

## Adding a GUI
The first thing that we're going to do is include a basic user interface that displays on our screen.

1. In your project hierarchy, click Create -> UI -> Canvas

2. Under your Canvas, right-click and add a UI -> Panel item under the Canvas item

3. In the Inspector for your Panel, change the scale to {x:.25, y:.25, z:.25} - we don't want this to cover the entire screen.

4. Change the color of the panel to be more visible, also in the Inspector tab

5. If needed, zoom out to see the full UI display. Adjust the positioning of your Panel to your desired location - in our example, we're putting this in the top right corner.

6. Making sure that the Panel is selected in the scene Hierarchy, right click one more time and create a UI -> Text item in the Panel

If you run your game now, you should see your panel floating in your camera view screen. We'll create a script to show and hide this later, but for now, let's finish up with the timer. We'll want to adjust our text block first so it's visible when we add in the timing component.

1. Select your text item and find the properties for the text block. For now, we can put a placeholder text in, so under the Text box, type in a temporary string.

2. Under the 'Paragraph' header, check the 'Best Fit' box and set the max size to 50.

3. Change the color of your text to contrast with your panel and save. When you run the game, you should see your static panel in your view and the text in front of you.
