# Create a new Unity Project
The first thing that we'll want to do once we've gotten Unity installed is create a new project. You will want to create an empty project set up with 3D defaults, but don't import any packages when you're prompted. We generally suggest not importing anything you don't need, since asset files will take up a lot of space, and importing packages in as needed while developing, which we'll go into later on.

When you create your project, you will have an empty screen in front of you, called a 'Scene'. This is the major component of a level in your game, and will be where you create all of your environment objects. Go ahead and save your scene - it's helpful to do this often because Unity doesn't currently have a great option for cleaning and refreshing projects as you make changes if it isn't done automatically. 

# About the Unity Editor
On first glance, if you haven't played around in Unity before, it can be a little overwhelming. Luckily, Unity Technologies has a series of informational videos that walk through the different aspects of the editor that can help familiarize you with the different components of the UI.

# Unity and Source Control
If this is your first time playing around with Unity, you may be realizing something: Unity projects can get big, and they can get big *fast*. At some point, if you continue building with Unity, you'll either want to implement some sort of source control or work on a project that involves collaboration, so it's important to get a feel for how this works with 3D Unity projects.
