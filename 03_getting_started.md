# Installing Unity
After completing this section, you will have Unity installed on your computer and be ready to start building your maze.

The first thing that you'll want to do is download Unity from the [Unity3d website](http://unity3d.com). Unity is available for Windows and Mac, though you can also run it in Wine on a Linux distro of your choosing. We'll walk you through the first two installation options here, and you can check out the Unity 3d wiki for instructions to get it running on Linux.

##Install Unity on Linux
While we won't get into the process of installing Unity on a Linux machine in detail here, there are a lot of great resources to help you get started with Unity on various Linux distributions. That said, some features are limited or unavailable when running through Wine (such as the asset store) and for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be assuming that you're running Unity on Windows or Mac OS.
