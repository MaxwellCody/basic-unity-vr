Install Unity

The first thing that you'll want to do is download Unity from the [Unity3d website](http://unity3d.com). Unity is available for Windows and Mac, though you can also run it in Wine on a Linux distro of your choosing. While we won't get into the process of installing Unity on a Linux machine in detail here, there are a lot of great resources to help you get started with Unity on various Linux distributions. That said, some features are limited or unavailable when running through Wine (such as the asset store) and for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be assuming that you're running Unity on Windows or Mac OS.

Note that the following links were tested on earlier versions of Unity, so you may see varying degrees of success with Unity 5.

# Licensing Information
When you install & run Unity for the first time, you'll be presented with a licensing screen with two options: activate Unity 5 Professional Edition or Personal Edition. Everything that we show you in this tutorial is done using Unity Personal Edition, which is really enough to get you started in the beginning.

# Sign In

Once you've activated Unity, you'll be prompted to sign in with your Unity account. If you haven't already created an account, you'll have the ability to create one within the application.
